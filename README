This is an embryonic interface to Amazon EC2 REST tools that follows the 2011-05-15
API. I created it because I needed access to the Tag and TagSet interfaces, and neither
euca2ools nor Net::Amazon::EC2 provided this functionality.

It will need to be refactored at some point in the near future. Major todos are:

 1. Get the right namespace
 2. Segregate the Object and ObjectSet modules
 3. Documentation

Contact me at lincoln.stein@gmail.com if you are interested in using or extending
this module.
